## PhD life

1.  [How has academia changed]{.blue} at the [PhD]{.orange} and [postdoc levels]{.orange} compared to when you went through it? Are things better, worse, or just... different with more Zoom?

. . .

2.  [When is it okay to abandon a project?]{.blue} *Not every idea is a brilliant one, and some projects slowly (or quickly) reveal themselves to be [dead ends]{.grey}. Sometimes we realize they are just not as exciting as we first thought, especially when other, more promising projects come along. How do you decide [when to pull the plug]{.orange}, both as a junior researcher and, hopefully one day, as a senior one?*

## The academic job: vocation, profession, or survival Game?


## The mentor, the mentee, and their delicate dance

3. [What are the qualities of a good mentor?]{.blue} *In your view, what makes someone a [great supervisor]{.orange} or mentor? What should we aim for if we want to guide others without becoming the kind of academic ghost story people tell in department hallways?*

## Next generation challenges

4. [In light of recent developments in AI and large language models (ChatGPT and friends), how should the teaching of Statistics--especially at the bachelor level--evolve?]{.blue} *Should we be rethinking what we teach, how we teach it, or both? What about theses and written projects?*
