## Hyperbolic secant regression


:::callout-tip
#### Background
- Let $Y_1,\dots,Y_n$ be independent random variable distributed according to a [hyperbolic secant distribution]{.orange}, whose [density]{.blue} is
$$
f(y_i; \theta_i) = \frac{\exp\{\theta_i y_i - \log{\cos(\theta_i)} \}}{2 \cosh(\pi y_i / 2)}, \qquad y_i \in \mathbb{R}, \; \theta_i \in \left(-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}\right).
$$
This distribution is discussed in @Morris1982 and is an instance of highly tractable [exponential family]{.orange} having a [quadratic variance]{.blue} function. 
:::


- This distribution can be employed build a novel generalized linear model (GLM), which automatically incorporates [heteroskedasticity]{.orange} and with [heavier tails]{.blue} that the Gaussian law.

- There are multiple application areas of such a regression technique, including (but not limited to) financial data. 

## Objectives and expectations

:::callout-tip
#### Research gap
- A systematic [Bayesian investigation]{.orange} of such a GLM is entirely missing. In principle, this GLM framework can be combined with modern Bayesian tool for regression, such as:
  - Variable selection and regularization, e.g. using shrinkage priors or spike-and-slab priors
  - Random effects (parametric and non-parametric).
  - Generalized Additive Models (GAMs), e.g. using Gaussian Processes.

- [Overdispersion]{.orange} may require novel generalized Bayes techniques [@Agnoletto2025].

- It is possible that a [Polya-gamma]{.blue} data augmentation scheme can be employed by adapting the results in @Polson2013. If not, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is certainly feasible.

#### Expected outcome

The group is expected to implement and develop 2-3 of the above research gaps. 

I expect that the group is proficient in R programming (C++ programming is a big plus but probably not necessary). Most of the work relates to the practical implementation of the above ideas.
