## PhD life

-  [How has academia changed]{.blue} at the [PhD]{.orange} and [postdoc levels]{.orange} compared to when you went through it? Are things better, worse, or just... different with more Zoom?

. . .

- We all have times when we feel [daunted]{.blue} by the [mathematical challenges]{.blue} associated with our work. How do you respond to feelings of [inadequacy]{.orange} or intimidation in the face of difficult problems?

. . .

-  [When is it okay to abandon a project?]{.blue} *Not every idea is a brilliant one, and some projects slowly (or quickly) reveal themselves to be [dead ends]{.grey}. How do you decide [when to pull the plug]{.orange}, both as a junior researcher and, hopefully one day, as a senior one?*

## The academic job: vocation, profession, or survival game?

## The mentor, the mentee, and their delicate dance

- [What are the qualities of a good mentor?]{.blue} *In your view, what makes someone a [great supervisor]{.orange} or mentor?*

- What advice do you have for [balancing]{.blue} [criticism]{.orange} and [support]{.grey} as a mentor? How do you cultivate a supporting but rigorous academic environment?

. . . 
 
- What are some methods for [establishing independence]{.blue} from your advisor(s) as your progress in your PhD?

. . .
 
 
- What role has [community]{.blue} played in your career and in your professional successes? Any [anecdotes]{.orange} about relationships formed early in your career that you maintain today?

## Next generation challenges

- In light of recent developments in AI and [large language models]{.blue} (ChatGPT and friends), how should the [teaching of Statistics]{.blue}, especially at the bachelor level, evolve? *Should we be rethinking what we teach, how we teach it, or both? What about [theses]{.orange} and [written projects]{.orange}?*
